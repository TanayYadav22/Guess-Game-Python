Today, you will face off against a clever computer that’s hiding a number between 1 and 100. Your mission? To uncover its secret… before your chances run out!

The game begins with a choice.
You decide the level of difficulty:

Easy Mode: 10 chances |
 Medium Mode: 5 chances |
 Hard Mode: only 3 chances.

Choose wisely… your fate depends on it


## Behind this simple yet thrilling game lies some clever Python magic.
1️⃣ First, the game summons a secret number using random.randint(1, 100)—that’s the hidden treasure the player must find.

2️⃣ Next, the player chooses a difficulty. With Easy, you get 10 tries… with Hard, only 3. The code assigns these chances using simple if-elif logic.

3️⃣ Then comes the guessing loop. Each time the player enters a number, the program checks:

If it matches, the player wins | If it’s too high, the computer says “lower.” | If it’s too low, the computer says “higher.”

4️⃣ Finally, if all attempts run out, the computer reveals its secret number… and declares victory over the challenger.
